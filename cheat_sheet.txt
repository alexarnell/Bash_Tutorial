This is the bash cheat sheet, below are extremely helpful
commands that you can use to help you navigate
and use the terminal to its full potential!

exit - exits the bash shell!

cd <path> - change to the directory given; with no 
arguments, chdir to the home directory; with a '-' 
as the only argument, chdirs to directory
previously in, the same as what tcsh does. Also, 
using cd with a '../' as the only argument will
bring you to the previous directory you were in.


pwd - print the current working directory. 


ls - with no arguments, lists the files
in the current working directory one per
line. With arguments, lists the files in each
directory given as an argument, with a blank
line then the name of the directory followed
by a : before the list of files in that directory.


ls -la: list all the files including hidden files in the
current working directory :)


kill <pid>- When given just a pid, sends
a SIGTERM to the process with that
pid using kill(2). When given a signal
number (with a - in front of it), sends
that signal to the pid. (e.g., kill 5678,
kill -9 5678).


cat <filename> - allows us to create single or multiple
files, view contain of file, concatenate files
and redirect output in terminal or files


pid - prints the pid of the shell


grep <filename> - a command-line utility for searching
plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular
expression.
